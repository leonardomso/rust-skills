> Profile before optimizing

## Why It Matters

Intuition about performance is often wrong. The code you think is slow frequently isn't, while actual bottlenecks hide in unexpected places. Profiling shows you exactly where time is spent, preventing wasted effort on optimizations that don't matter.

Decide early whether the crate affects fleet cost, throughput, or latency. If it
does, identify its hot paths, benchmark them, and profile both CPU time and
allocations under representative load. Record the sensitive paths and their
budgets near the benchmark or in contributor guidance so later changes do not
silently move work back into them.

## Bad

```rust
// Optimizing without measuring
fn process(data: &[Item]) -> Vec<Output> {
    // "I bet this clone is slow..."
    let cloned: Vec<_> = data.iter().cloned().collect();
    
    // Actually, 99% of time is spent here:
    cloned.iter().map(|x| expensive_computation(x)).collect()
}

// Over-engineering rarely-called code
#[inline(always)]
fn rarely_called() {
    // This runs once at startup...
}
```

## Good

```rust
// 1. Profile first
// cargo flamegraph --bin myapp
// cargo instruments -t time --bin myapp (macOS)

// 2. Find the actual bottleneck
// Flamegraph shows expensive_computation takes 95% of time

// 3. Optimize the hot spot
fn process(data: &[Item]) -> Vec<Output> {
    // Clone is fine - only 1% of time
    let cloned: Vec<_> = data.iter().cloned().collect();
    
    // Focus optimization HERE
    cloned.par_iter()  // Parallelize the expensive part
        .map(|x| expensive_computation(x))
        .collect()
}
```

## Profiling Tools

### Flamegraphs (Recommended Start)

```bash
# Install
cargo install flamegraph

# Profile
cargo flamegraph --bin myapp -- <args>

# Opens flamegraph.svg showing call stacks by time
```

### perf (Linux)

```bash
# Record
perf record -g cargo run --release

# Report
perf report

# Or generate flamegraph
perf script | inferno-collapse-perf | inferno-flamegraph > flamegraph.svg
```

### Instruments (macOS)

```bash
# Install cargo-instruments
cargo install cargo-instruments

# Time profiler
cargo instruments -t time --release

# Allocations profiler
cargo instruments -t alloc --release
```

### DHAT (Heap Profiling)

```bash
# In your code
#[global_allocator]
static ALLOC: dhat::Alloc = dhat::Alloc;

fn main() {
    let _profiler = dhat::Profiler::new_heap();
    // ... your code
}

# Run and get allocation report
cargo run --release
```

### criterion (Micro-benchmarks)

```rust
use criterion::{criterion_group, criterion_main, Criterion};
use std::hint::black_box;

fn bench_my_function(c: &mut Criterion) {
    c.bench_function("my_function", |b| {
        b.iter(|| my_function(black_box(input)))
    });
}

criterion_group!(benches, bench_my_function);
criterion_main!(benches);
```

Keep symbols in optimized benchmark builds so profilers can attribute the work:

```toml
[profile.bench]
debug = 1
```

## What to Look For

```
Flamegraph Reading:
├── Width = time spent
├── Height = call stack depth
└── Look for:
    ├── Wide bars (time hogs)
    ├── malloc/free (allocation heavy)
    ├── memcpy (copying data)
    └── Unexpected functions taking time
```

## Common Findings

```rust
// Finding: HashMap operations are slow
// Fix: Use FxHashMap or AHashMap for non-crypto hashing

// Finding: String allocation in hot loop
// Fix: Pre-allocate with capacity, use &str

// Finding: Clone in hot path
// Fix: Use references or Cow

// Finding: Bounds checks visible in profile
// Fix: Use iterators instead of indexing

// Finding: Lock contention
// Fix: Reduce critical section, use RwLock, or partition data
```

## Optimization Workflow

```
1. Decide whether performance or unit cost is a product constraint
2. Write correct code first
3. Identify and document the sensitive paths and budgets
4. Write benchmarks for those paths
5. Profile CPU and allocations under realistic load
6. Optimize ONE measured bottleneck
7. Measure improvement
8. Repeat if needed
```

> "The biggest performance improvements often come from changes to algorithms or data structures, rather than low-level optimizations."

> "It is worth understanding which Rust data structures and operations cause allocations, because avoiding them can greatly improve performance."
